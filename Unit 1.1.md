# Unit 1.1: Intro to Python

### Introduction, What is Python and Why Python?
1. popular high-level programming language
⋅⋅⋅From Machine, to readable code, that’s going from low level to high level. ⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅The lower the level, the closer the language is to machine code (binary). ⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅The higher the level, the closer it is to actual spoken languages. ⋅⋅

2. Easy to learn! Great for first-timers.
3. Many startups and tech companies use it, including Google, Yahoo!
4. An increasingly common language for Computer Science 101 courses in universities as it is very clean and readable.
5. Great language to learn how to make web applications

### Introduction to the coding environment
### Hello World
` print "Hello World!" ` 


### Data
⋅⋅⋅information that is useful in some way.⋅⋅

# subtraction
print 2018 - 2009
# multiplication
print 10 * 6
# division
print 32/8
```

### Comments
1. allow programmers to communicate with each other to explain the code.
2. skipped by the computer while evaluating the program code.
